# Keeps ECS→AWS-API traffic (ECR pulls, SSM parameter reads, KMS decrypts,
# CloudWatch Logs writes) inside the VPC instead of round-tripping through the
# NAT gateway and the public internet path — the same traffic the ecs_tasks
# security group's 0.0.0.0/0:443 egress rule (network.tf) would otherwise
# carry there. Narrowing that egress rule bought nothing on its own if every
# AWS SDK call still had to leave the VPC to reach it; these endpoints are
# what makes the narrowing actually change the traffic's path, not just its
# security-group accounting.
#
# Every endpoint below gets the SAME restriction: only THIS account's own IAM
# principals may use it, full stop — actions and resources are left to IAM
# (iam.tf already scopes those tightly, per role; duplicating that scoping
# here would be a second copy of the same invariant, drifting the moment one
# side changes without the other). What an endpoint policy adds that IAM
# alone can't is a floor under a credentials-compromise scenario an IAM
# policy never reaches: if a task somehow ended up holding another account's
# credentials (a copy-pasted key, a supply-chain compromise), those
# credentials could still authenticate to AWS — but this condition refuses
# them at the endpoint before the call ever reaches the service, because
# they're not THIS account's principal. This is deliberately NOT
# s3:ResourceAccount-style resource restriction on the S3 endpoint — this
# same Gateway endpoint carries ECR's own image-layer blob storage (comment
# below), which lives in AWS-owned buckets outside this account entirely;
# restricting by resource account would break every image pull.
